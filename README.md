# Aircraft-Trajectory-Planning-Optimization_OA

Project for the course Optimization and Algorithms.

The project consists in implementing an optimization algorithm from the paper presented in Documentation, or exploring some reformulations of it.
The goal was solving an optimization problem for trajectories of multiple aircrafts, with collision avoidance, using CVX in Matlab.
